# compounding-interest
A simple calculator I made in Python to help me visualize some compounding interest problems

The calculator allows me to input starting principal, yearly additions, yearly withdrawals, interest rates, and the amount of years used for that specific batch of settings. It runs through with the user-inputting settings, printing the amount withdrawn and the new principal until finished, where it asks the user if they want to run the program again. A rerun of the program asks the user for all of the same inputs except the principal, as it uses the latest new principal.

I made this to visualize how much I could make if I invested and lived off 4% of my principal.
Specifically, I used 0 starting principal, 25000 yearly investment, 0 takeout, 8% interest rate, and 15 years as my settings to simulate investing $25000 a year from ages 25 to 40 with an 8% return (VTSAX's 15 year average return is 8.79%). I could then input settings of 0 yearly investment, 4% takeout, the same 8% interest rate and 15 years to see how much I'd be able to withdraw each year at 4% and what my principal would be if I didn't invest from ages 40-55.
